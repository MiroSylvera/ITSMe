## Goal

The goal of the ITSMe package is to provide easy to use functions to
quickly obtain structural metrics from individual tree point clouds and
their respective TreeQSMs.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ITSMe from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lmterryn/ITSMe")
```

## Input

The functions are developed for tree point clouds obtained with TLS and
quantitative structure models (QSMs) obtained with TreeQSM
(<https://github.com/InverseTampere/TreeQSM>).

## Individual tree structural metrics

The structural metrics which can be calculated with this package are
summarized in the tables below:
