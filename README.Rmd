## Goal

The goal of the ITSMe R package is to provide easy to use functions to quickly 
obtain structural metrics from individual tree point clouds and their respective 
TreeQSMs. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of ITSMe from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lmterryn/ITSMe")
```
## Input

The functions are developed for tree point clouds obtained with TLS
and quantitative structure models (QSMs) obtained with TreeQSM 
(https://github.com/InverseTampere/TreeQSM).

## Individual tree structural metrics 

Structural metrics which can be calculated with the ITSMe package are 
summarized in the tables below.

### Basic structural metrics

| structural metric             | function name                     | input              |
| ------------------------------|:---------------------------------:|-------------------:|
| diameter at breast height (m) | dbh_pc, dbh_qsm                   | point cloud, QSM   |
| diameter above buttresses (m) | dab_pc                            | point cloud        |
| tree height (m)               | tree_height_pc, tree height_qsm   | point cloud, QSM   |
| projected crown area (m$^{2}$)| projected_crown_area_pc           | point cloud        |
| crown volume (m$^{3}$)        | volume_crown_pc                   | point cloud        |
| tree volume (m$^{3}$)         | tree_volume_qsm                   | QSM                |
| trunk volume (m$^{3}$)        | trunk_volume_qsm                  | QSM                |
| total branch volume (m$^{3}$) | total_branch_volume_qsm           | QSM                |
| total branch length (m)       | total_branch_length_qsm           | QSM                |
| total cylinder length (m)     | total_cyl_length_qsm              | QSM                |


### Structural metrics from Terryn et al. (2020)

These are the metrics defined in 
[Terryn et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.08.009) 
and were copied and adapted from 
[Akerblom et al., (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2016.12.002) 
except for the branch angle ratio and the relative volume ratio. Definitions of 
the metrics can be found in the help files of the functions and the papers of 
Terryn et al. (2020) and Akerblom et al. (2017). Normalisation according to 
Terryn et al. (2020) as well as Akerblom et al. (2017) is possible through the 
normalisation parameter included in the functions of the metrics that were 
adapted by Terryn et al. (2020). If the tree point cloud is provided along with 
the TreeQSM in the functions, dbh and tree height values are based on the point 
clouds rather than the QSMs. When the buttress parameter is indicated "TRUE" the 
diameter above buttresses rather than the dbh is used.

## Examples

Calculating the diameter at breast height versus the diameter above buttresses 
of a tree:
```{r}
library(ITSMe)
#Specify path to the tree point cloud file
PC_path <- system.file("extdata", "example_pointcloud_1.ply", package = "ITSMe")
#Read the point cloud file
pc <- read_tree_pc(path = PC_path)
#Use dbh_pc function with default parameters and plot the fit
dbh <- dbh_pc(pc = pc,plot = TRUE)
#Use dab_pc function with default parameters and plot the fit
dab <- dab_pc(pc = pc,thresholdbuttress = 0.001,maxbuttressheight = 9,
              plot = TRUE)
```

Calculating the stem branch distance of a TreeQSM:
```{r}
library(ITSMe)
#Specify path to the TreeQSM file
QSM_path <- system.file("extdata", "example_qsm_1_1.mat", package = "ITSMe")
#Read the TreeQSM file
qsm <- read_tree_qsm(path = QSM_path)
#Use stem_branch_distance_qsm function
sbd <- stem_branch_distance_qsm(cylinder = qsm$cylinder,treedata = qsm$treedata,
                                normalisation = "dbh")
#Using the point cloud information for more accurate dbh normalisation
PC_path <- system.file("extdata", "example_pointcloud_1.ply", package = "ITSMe")
pc <- read_tree_pc(path = PC_path)
sbd <- stem_branch_distance_qsm(cylinder = qsm$cylinder,treedata = qsm$treedata,
                                normalisation = "dbh",pc = pc,buttress = TRUE)
```

Calculating a summary data.frame with the basic structural metrics 
(tree position, dbh, dab, tree height, projected crown area, crown volume) that 
can be  obtained from individual tree point clouds for all point clouds in a 
specific folder: 
```{r eval = FALSE}
library(ITSMe)
#Specify the path to the folder containing multiple tree point cloud files
PCs_path <- "path/to/point/cloud/folder/"
#Run summary function 
basic_summary <- summary_basic_pointcloud_metrics(PCs_path = PCs_path, 
                                                  extension = ".txt")
```

Calculating a summary data.frame with the structural metrics defined by Terryn
et al. (2020) for all TreeQSMs in a specific folder: 
```{r eval = FALSE}
library(ITSMe)
#Specify the path to the folder containing the respective tree point cloud files
QSMs_path <- "path/to/QSM/folder/"
#If you cant DBH/DAB and height to be calculated based on tree point clouds:
#Specify the path to the folder containing the respective tree point cloud files
PCs_path <- "path/to/point/cloud/folder/"
#Run summary function with default parameter settings
Terryn_summary <- summary_Terryn_2020(QSMs_path = QSMs_path,version = "2.4.0",
                                      PCs_path = PCs_path,buttress = TRUE, 
                                      extension = ".txt")
```
